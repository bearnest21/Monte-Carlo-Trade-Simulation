# Monte-Carlo-Trade-Simulation
I use the returns from a trade strategy and stress test using monte carlo. It is currently set up to take 1000 random samples from the returns and repeat 1000 times.  The code can be modified to run the simulation with as many samples and simulations as you would like.
